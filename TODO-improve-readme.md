## New TODO Tasks
- [ ] Documentation Clarity: The README.md provides a good overview of the project, but it could be improved by adding more context about the project's purpose and its benefits. For example, it could explain why generating Mermaid diagrams for CloudFormation templates is useful and how it can help users understand their AWS infrastructure better.
- [ ] Error Handling: The TODO-aws.md file mentions adding error handling, logging, and monitoring to the Python script. This is crucial for understanding and debugging issues that may arise during the execution of the Lambda function. It would be beneficial to expand on this point in the documentation, perhaps by providing examples of common errors and how to handle them.
- [ ] Dependencies: The README.md mentions the use of OpenAI and AWS services, but it doesn't provide a comprehensive list of all the dependencies required for the project. It would be helpful to include a requirements.txt file or similar in the repository to make it easier for users to install all necessary dependencies.
