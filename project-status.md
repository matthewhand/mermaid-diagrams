# Project Status Report

## Overview

We are working on a project that involves managing and executing Python notebooks in Noteable, and interacting with a GitHub repository. The GitHub repository contains workflows that are part of a CI/CD pipeline.

## Recent Activities

Recently, we have been investigating the status of the workflows in the GitHub repository. We found that the latest runs for all workflows have failed. This indicates that there might be issues with the code or the workflows themselves that are causing the failures.

## Findings

We fetched some information about the failed workflow runs, such as the run number, the commit that triggered the run, the event that triggered the run, and the timestamp of the run. We found that all the failed runs were triggered by the same commit. This suggests that there might be something in that commit that is causing the failures.

## Next Steps

To further investigate these failures, we can examine the commit that triggered the runs and the changes it introduced. We can also check the configuration of the workflows and the scripts they are running to see if there are any issues there. However, this would involve a deep understanding of the project codebase and the workflows, and might not be feasible within the scope of this task. It would be best to involve a developer who is familiar with the project and the workflows to investigate these failures.

## Conclusion

While we have made some progress in investigating the workflow failures, there is still work to be done to identify and fix the issues. We will continue to work on this and provide updates as we make progress.
