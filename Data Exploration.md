# Data Exploration
This file describes the data exploration process for the project.
- Understand the data: Look at the data and understand its structure, the types of data, and the values it contains.
- Visualize the data: Use plots and charts to visualize the data and understand its distribution and relationships.
- Identify outliers: Look for values that are significantly different from the rest of the data.
- Identify missing values: Look for missing or null values in the data.
- Identify correlations: Look for relationships between different variables in the data.

The results of the data exploration process should be documented in the `Data Exploration.ipynb` notebook.
